			<notes>The character possesses healing capabilities not dissimilar to various species of lizards, starfish, and arthropods. They heal somewhat faster, gaining a +2 bonus to natural healing tests. Additionally, they can regrow lost limbs and other body parts given time. In game terms, the character will regrow any lost limb or destroyed organ (assuming they survive whatever destroyed said limb or organ) in one month's time. Regrowing a limb takes a lot of resources. The character increases their lifestyle cost by 10% during any month in which they have regrown or are in the process of regrowing a limb.</notes>

			<notes>The character has glands capable of producing and shooting a sticky black ink. To make use of this ink, the character makes a Ranged Attack Test using the Exotic Ranged Weapon (Ink) + Agility [Physical], with a range of (Body) meters. A successful hit from this attack deals no damage, but leaves the target completely blind (treat as having been hit with a called shot to each eye). The ink clears from an uncovered eye automatically after 1 combat turn. A covered eye or camera does not clear up on its own and requires a complex action to scrub off the sticky ink, or requires the wearer to remove the covering using the appropriate action. Creatures that do not perceive vision via eyes or cameras (e.g. spirits) are of course immune. The ink will also stain skin for about a week and will permanently stain most clothing and other fabrics.</notes>

			<notes>These wings transform an individual’s arms into gliders(similar to a sugar glider). They work in a similar way as the URBAN EXPLORER DAEDALUS wingsuit and are compatible with armor, as long as the armor has been adjusted(10% price increase). While flying, any other physical action besides flight and/or gymnastics, receive a negative 2 dice modifier (including the use of magic). The gliders can not be used while a full chemseal is active without breaking it.

			<notes>You grow 2 functional wings on your back, giving you a flying speed of 2x/4x/+3m. The wings can fold in and be hidden under thick clothing(although still visible, if for example under a t-shirt). This is rather taxing for your body as doing so requires a lighter body. Your bones will become hollow like a bird and make you  suffer a -1 dice pool modifier to all physical Damage Resistance tests. These wings also act as claws with a Damage of (S+2)P -2 AP. Using these wings together with armor requires a refit (such as putting in flaps), which costs 20% of the base price. The wings can not be used while a full chemseal is active without breaking it.

			<notes>Similar to type 2, you gain a flying speed. The difference is that this type of flying is based on mystical rather than physical forces and works similar to the way eastern dragons are able to fly. You gain a flying speed equal to 3x/6x/+5. While this quality does not give you any actual wings, it is not uncommon that those with magical flight manifest spectral like wings visible on the astral and the physical plane when they are using them.
If you ever lose your magic attribute, you can't use the wings this way. Nevertheless, they still provide fall damage reduction equal to 3 levels of the freefall adept power(9 meter), even when you lose your magic rating.

			<notes>This mutation acts similarly to the Striking Skin Pigmentation metagenic quality, but for one’s eyes. The mutant’s sclera shows a very unique color. Red, Black, Blue. This mutation's coloration varies wildly, but must be unique for the race to which it belongs. When the runner’s eyes have been perceived, all Matrix Searches and Memory Tests to recall what the character looks like receive a +1 dice bonus. This stacks with Striking Skin Pigmentation.
If the character ever replaces his eyes with cybereyes, he must buy of this quality instantly or go into karma debt until it is paid off.

			<notes>The SURGE affected your lower body quite heavily, fusing your legs together completely and elongating them into a single long, snakelike limb. This gives you an incredibly striking appearance, granting everyone +4 dice to Memory Tests to remember your appearance, or to search about you on the Matrix. This stacks with Striking Skin Pigmentation and Striking Sclera. In addition your movements are more sluggish, causing you to change your movement rates to Agility x 1 for walking and Agility x 2 for running, sprinting (+0.5m/hit). Finally, this mutation also removes your ability to gain and use Cyberlegs, unless you gain a Liminal Body and buy off this quality. 

If this quality is taken in concert with Adiposis you are always counted as ‘running’ even when moving at walking speed, requiring a free action to move. In addition you count your Agility as one lower for the purposes of Movement speed.

			<notes>The character's skin is fragile and constantly covered in a protective slime. This slime leaves them more prone to dehydration, halving all intervals in which fatigue is rolled in dry or hot areas. Additionally, as the slime dries off they become increasingly uncomfortable. They are treated as suffering from a minor allergy if they have taken any fatigue damage caused by dehydration. For every 3 fatigue damage the character has taken this way, the allergy is treated as being one step higher in severity, up to severe. Characters with the Slime Coating quality suffer social stigma and modifiers. This is incompatible with bioware, or cyberware that alter the skin.

			<notes>You don't need to drink! Well you do actually, but similar to a frog, you take in water through your skin. This leaves you highly susceptible to many toxins and pollutants. Liquid ingestion vector toxins and drugs can affect you through mere contact as if they had been mixed with DMSO, and you take a -4 to resist toxins that are normally (or have through DMSO been made) contact vector. This quality is incompatible with orthoskin.

			<notes>Something about lying on your back is just so relaxing, kind of like how sharks go into a trance when flipped onto their back. Unfortunately this means that when you're dropped down on your back you have some real trouble getting back up. In order to get up when lying on your back, including being knocked prone (but not after dropping prone by your own choice, you are assumed to be smart enough to belly flop for that), you must roll a Composure (3) test before you can attempt the normal test to get back up.

			<notes>Also known as irregular cranial or skull configurations, AHD normally manifests as significant physical diversion from standard metahuman structure and appearance. These can be in nearly any form of such, often fitting in with features that are found among other species of the world. The difference in these appearances is they are principally cosmetic for the purposes of game mechanics. All of these apply Freaks.
			Avian
These individuals have had their cranial/aural properties adjusted to appear like those of common avians, including pronounced narrow jaw lines (but not into full beaks), widened or enlarged optical cavities, and similar traits.

The difference in these appearances is they are principally cosmetic for the purposes of game mechanics. All of these apply Freaks.
			Canine/Feline
This is a very common trait, with an assortment of canine and feline variations. It provides pronounced jawlines, slight changes to teeth (not enough to use them as weapons), and even shifts in the position of the ears.

			Pachy (Rhino, Elephant, Hippo)
Individuals have widened upper aural helices, often with some adjustment to the position of ears. They also display vestigial horns (rhino), proboscis (elephantine), or widened jaws with distally placed teeth (hippo). Appearances are often leathery along the cranial and upper torso.

			<notes>It’s one thing to be bald, another to be hairless. This individual no longer has any hair or hair follicles anywhere on their body (though skin pores do exist). This affects the entire dermal biome and overall appearance. Sweating is more difficult, and social engagements with metahumans can be awkward. First social encounters with metahumans are done with a –1 dice pool modifier. The individual also shows up more easily on thermographic vision and thermal sensors, giving +1 for Perception tests to see them. Incompatible with Hair based bioware or cyberware.

			<notes>Your hair is made up of tendrils, tentacles, snakes or some other wriggly things (up to you). It flows and moves like a living organism and while you have limited control over it, it also seems to have a mind of its own, acting involuntarily based on your subconscious.
Your hair can hold onto items but it has difficulty with fine manipulation. Apply a -6 dice modifier to any attempt at fine manipulation of an object with your hair, such as pressing a button, pulling a trigger or making an attack. Your Living Hair has an effective Strength equal to half the character's unaugmented strength and Agility equal to  the character’s unaugmented agility (rounded down) and a Reach of -1. Living Hair does not provide any extra attacks. If you have the Natural Venom quality (RF 117), the venom can be administered via stinger cells at the end of your Living Hair as an Injection Vector.
Physical or emotional stress can cause your Living Hair to react unpredictably, forcing you to make a Composure (3) Test (SR5 152). Failing the test will cause the hair to lash out and try to attack anyone nearby (preferably the cause of the stress), injecting any venom if available. The hair doesn’t suffer from the -6 dice penalty and has 6 ranks in Unarmed when making this attack. This can cause surrounding people to react negatively or with outright hostility.
Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123). However, when making an Intimidation test, you don’t suffer from Freak Modifiers, instead you gain a +1 dice bonus as long as your Living Hair is fully visible. This quality is incompatible with any other natural or artificial hair modifications such as Feathers (RF 120) or Mood Hair (RF 121).

Additionally, when making defense tests to avoid being Subdued (SR5 195) or Clinched (RF 119) as well as tests made to escape Subdue or Clinch, the character gains a +2 dice bonus. If the character has the Natural Venom quality (RF 117), the venom can be secreted as a Contact Vector Toxin via the cutaneous slime.
The character leaves slime wherever they go. Not a lot, but just enough to be noticeable and disgusting. Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123). Moreover, any test to Clinch, Subdue, Climb and maintain a grip on things is made at a -2 dice penalty. It’s also almost impossible to not leave some genetic marker behind. Matrix Search tests and other tests to identify or locate the character are made with a +1 die bonus. This quality is incompatible with Dermal Alteration (RF 113) or artificial skin modifications, but is compatible with other natural skin modifications such as Dermal Deposits or Defensive Secretion (RF 114).

The character takes a -2 dice penalty to all Physical Active Skills. The character also suffers an added -1 dice penalty to olfactory Perception tests. Finally, fatigue DV from running (SR5 172) is increased by a cumulative +1S, every time you make a fatigue resistance test for running. Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123).

			<notes>You have unfortunately developed multiple features that resemble demons as portrayed by many cultures. The features can be fangs, horns, wings, tail, etc. Whatever they may be, they are cosmetic only, and provide no mechanical benefit unless an appropriate quality is also chosen. Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123) as well as the effects of the Distinctive Style quality (SR5 80).
It also causes the character to suffer the Hostile (SR5 140) social modifier when encountering any religious NPCs. The NPC may outrightly refuse to deal with this character or even act with hostility. If drawn into combat, such people may attack the character first (to remove the apparent evil).

At the beginning of each run, you must make a Body (2) test to see if you start molting. If you fail this roll, you suffer a -1 die penalty to all skill tests for the length of the run due to discomfort of your skin slowly molting throughout the entire run. In addition, your skin requires special care and maintenance to avoid infections, increasing your lifestyle cost by +20%.

Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123).
On the plus side, if you have the Fangs quality (RF 115), the Accuracy of your fangs is improved by +1. This quality is incompatible with the bioware modification Muzzle (CF 121).

			<notes>You embody death and decay, creatures that feed on carrion regularly call you their home. You resemble something akin to a traditional, decomposing zombie with a stench of decay. Only the strongest of will and stomach can take more than a short conversation in your presence. Any person within conversation distance of you will need to take a Composure (2) test to remain in your presence. If they fail, they will move away from you out of disgust and you will suffer an additional -3 dice penalty to all Social tests against that person. Your necrotic flesh makes healing difficult as your own immune system fights off any attempts to heal. All Healing tests performed on you, including natural healing are done at a -3 dice penalty.
On the plus side, you feel less pain and can ignore two additional boxes of damage when calculating Wound Modifiers (SR5 169). Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123).

They cannot wear eyeglasses, for they have no ears upon which to rest the temples. However, a metahuman is not a lizard and though the hearing of a reptile is generally known to be rather good, it doesn’t translate well for the character.
Any test involving hearing takes a -3 dice penalty. The character’s hearing cannot be repaired or corrected (even with cyber ears) due to the internal differences of a normal metahuman ear and the character’s. Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 124).

			<notes>For some reason, you are an anathema to all spirit kind. Similar to Spirit Bane (SR5 85), a character with this quality really pisses off spirits, of all kinds. Any spirit within five meters of the character, that has not been summoned by them, reacts with hostility towards the character. Spirits will always use lethal force against characters with the Spirit Blight quality.
A character with this quality has a difficult time summoning or binding spirits and in combat an opposing spirit will seek her out and attempt to destroy the character first.

The character suffers a -2 dice pool modifier to summon or bind spirits. If the character tries to banish a spirit, the spirit receives a +2 dice pool modifier for resisting their attempt. Spirit Blight is compatible with the Spirit Bane quality and the penalties stack.

			<notes>This is like albinism, but worse. Instead of a simple lack of pigment, the skin is translucent. The veins of the character are clearly visible, giving their skin a blue tint. Like an albino, their skin and hair have a complete lack of pigment, resulting in pink or crystal blue irises and bright red pupils with pure white hair.
They face a Weak Glare penalty (SR5 175) to all actions when working in regular indoor lighting or an overcast day, and a Moderate Glare penalty when working on a sunny day. All other Glare modifiers are increased by one level. Normal compensation methods work to mitigate the modifiers.
Due to the lack of protective pigmentation, they suffer sunburn more quickly and harshly. Halve the duration between resistance tests when exposed to the sun for extended periods and increase the base DV by 1 as per the Sunburn rules (RG 147).
Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (Freaks sidebar, RF 123). This quality is incompatible with Albinism (RF 151) or any other natural or artificial skin modification.
